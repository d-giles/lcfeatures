    "This notebook previously sought to explore the utility of dimensionality reduction with PCA prior to clustering considering 3 levels of variance explained: 90%, 95%, and 99%. \n",
    "Aside from the reduction, the data was processed in the same way as done previously. Prior to dimensionality reduction, the was scaled using sklearn's standardScaler. After reduction, the data was clustered using the method clusterOutliers.db_out.\n",
    "These reductions were compared to the clustering on the full set of features from the paper as well as a rerun of the clustering on the full set of features (the rerun is hereafter referred to as the baseline) and a summary of these results is stored in the Google Sheets file 'PCA Reduction'.\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "Treating the paper data as the ground truth:\n",
    "Precision: 100%, Recall: 68%\n",
    "The paper data had a stricter definition of a cluster and contained essentially every non-core data point identified in the reductions and the rerun baseline. Almost every point identified as an outlier or an edge member in the reductions was identified as such in the paper's results. If we treat the paper as the ground truth (problematic) then the precision of the reductions is perfect.\n",
    "The reductions (and rerun baseline) clustered more of the data and identified between 63% and 70% of the non-core identified in the paper data, a recall (assuming the paper is the ground truth) of about 68%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating the new baseline (reclustering on the full set of features) as the ground truth:\n",
    "Precision: 90%-99%, recall: 85%-90%\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduced recall as compared to the paper is mitigated when examining against the re-clustered data. There is not a simple way to say exactly how good the results of the reduced data are since there is no simple way of saying what the ground truth should really be as there is not a simple way of defining what an outlier should be."
